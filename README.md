## 🚢 Submarine Hunt
It's a simple game developed in C. The gamer is the BattleShip, and he has to attack the Submarine in the ocean.

### 👾 "How do I play?" 
``` #C
printf("\nBATTLESHIP'S POSITION: ");
// You write two numbers (from 0 to 2), for example: 0 1
// So, you are READY to attack the Submarine!
```
